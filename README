/who - coloured, sorted list of players
/ranks - coloured, sorted list of ranks
/rank <player> - look up the rank of a player

In order to use:
Drop the .jar into your plugins folder. Then change the config in
CommandBook:
	online-on-join: false

It expects the colour of each rank ('&a' for example) to be the prefix
and the name of the rank to be the suffix (ex: for green templars:
	prefix: '&a'
	suffix: 'Templar'
	
Also, the 'rank' of each rank must be set, with the highest number being
the lowest rank.

Ex:
Peon:
	options:
		rank: 1000
Elder:
	options:
		rank: 500
God:
	options:
		rank: 0
